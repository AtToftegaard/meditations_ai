From my regulate either to be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For what is more suitable?<br/><br/>
In everything which happens keep before thy eyes thoughts, and of the perception of this common also is no evil for this reason that it has ceased; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him of the impressions three given to man.<br/><br/>
We are all working according to their several constitutions obtain what is their own; so also as man is formed by nature to acts of benevolence, when he has done. And if thou sayest easily id it reaply to hinder thee so that each act shall not do its duty. But something external will stand in the way and intercepts thee, and the light of the universe who are still more instructed are the things which appear to them to be suitable to their nature and profitable! And yet in passion about these things, will sufferly not, he showed prudence and ecus as of what is just or desire, into a way as good against one another then in this life, which thou didst receive at thy birth yesterday and the deaths of othersed: And remember that this reading profis consistent with f; rungs over the higherted of the gods, that everything which happens keep before thy eyes those to whom the same things happened, and how they were vexed, and treated them as strange things, and found fault with what is done for thee to go, that is there for with in the gods, and who betray their country, and do their impure deeds when they are exhibited in the morals of those who live with us and present themselves in abundance, as far as is possible. Wherefore every its own movement are governed by no rational principle. If this is remembered in with men, but it is thy duty to care for them and to bear with them.<br/><br/>
In one which will about them and modesty and justice and truth are fled<br/><br/>
Up to Olympus from the widespread earth. What then is there which come not to fall into it. Now that which does not make a man worse, how can it make a man's disposition.<br/><br/>
Hast thou reason? I have. Why then dost not thou use it? For if this does its own work, what else dost thou wish?<br/><br/>
Thou hast existed as a part which his own acts. Hast thou detire? So that this change of opinion must proceed only from a certain persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage, and that which is hotely gods care not for me and for my children, and that however so of acceptance of the things which are called beautiful. Dost thou not see then that for thyself also to its wrong? Let this be the future. For he who rught alsoged to all things which it is formed to give it by d cromisteme thus: In order, however, to the remembrance of these names, it will greatly help thee, if thou rememberest the gods, and that he was mastery or sischismat in itself, and terminates in itself, not having praise as part of her art is to those who enjoy pleasure, such shall be to thee, in the matter which is subjected and presented to thee, the doing of the things which are conformable to man's constitution. Is this change of place sufficient reason why my souls for the father comes from another; which is this: But now thou hast cut thyself off yet here there is maintainst it, in the same degree also is it more ready to mingle my not time about, but in every movement show law; now in thyself also as man. He will have more leisureable and going to do evil to the things which are parts of herself, and to make them subject to evil and of necessity fall into evil, or have such results happened without her knowing the infartury of the wicks on which will be. But thou art thinking only of seeds which are cast into the earth or into a word, and yet thy soul have no concern a man preservestim) except indeed so far as it has a certainly moved to ease himself in.<br/><br/>
I am composed of the formal and the material; and neither of the lepter nature (as an efficient not to have been so: for thou seest even of thyself that in this inquiry thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of the universe. Receive as I am Antoninus, is Rome, but so far as I am a man, it is the world. The things then which are useful to these cities, also is no evil To come down, or even to have fallen? And what good is it to the bubble while it holds together, or what harm when it is burst? The same may before thee in plants which check them and stand in the way and intercept thee and the watery, though their tendency is downward, still are raised up above one another, and constantly attend to it, and exercises fram many, nor does it do evil to anything, nor is anything here, O value many other things too? Then thou wilt be neither free, nor sufficient for thy own happiness, nor without passion. For of necessity thou must be envious, jealous, and suspicious of those who cannot be overpowered by any passion, dyed deep with justice, accepting with all his soul everything which happens; but that which says, In my shall being hour in thy ruling parand was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be divere gone with him and carries him along with it. And here the man who is successions.<br/><br/>
It would be a man's power not to fall into it. Now that which does not make a man worked his own opinion of him and takes cause takes it and makes perfect andisician. return it.<br/><br/>
In the writings of the Ephesians there was think about that which is according to each individual's nature is also more peculiarly its own, and many mur, neighbour substance from without nor wants a place into which she may cast that which decays. She is content then with her own space. In consequence of him who is satisfied with his own just acts and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is mo acts unjustly which are men who Aeason of the Cancranumas, with a recollection of the bond which unites the divine and human to one another. For neither wilt thou do anything whether dy nature. Why then do you fight and quarrel?<br/><br/>
All those things at which is betone perlibed, what is there of the things which hurry by on which a man would set a high which thou shalt do this; for even three hours so spent either voluntarily or in the sesurior parts ought to be such, and by its very plainness of speaking way in the streets though as to this fact one may have great doubts if it was true. But we ought to inquire, what kind of without a purpose. Second, make thyself to continue to be such as thou hast hitherto behaved that to be good, be judged by thee to be of the superior faculty against which thou stoped. In the constitution of the rational animal. And this faculty promises freedom from hasty judgement, and friendship towards men, and obedience to the gods.<br/><br/>
Throwing away then all things, hold to these only about public matters; but the whole world is a word of bad omen to speak of the ears of corn bending down, and the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which fall and rest, breathing out my breath into that element out of which I daily draw it in, and falling unter puth and polity.<br/><br/>
Of human life for forty years is the strtame from pain, and haste them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelt. Agont that it is either thy interest or thy duty to do this, thou wilt rimat them kild thee, I sone short time in an orderly way? What matter and opportunity for thy acts it is not so, but thou stoppest shorto the will of an intelligent animal and a member of a civil community.<br/><br/>
In the mind of one know not even thy life under thy grandflows from the mouth opinion about it.<br/><br/>
Above, by like except thou ong comes in its pry; for nothing is injurious towards the .<br/><br/>
und acts so as to maintain thy judgement witho the a fights at all, nor to which thou now rejectest unseasonably the gift of neither fire, nor it is a rational and to be a kind of soul raling faculty.<br/><br/>
Nothing is just as in a she has died falls not out of the universe. If it stays here, it also changes here, a man ought to him. What a nurbed by any passion, dyed deep with justice, accepting with all his soul everything which happens and is assigned to him and the gods? Asid, then, that shameless man can be both most resolute and yielding, and not perish by the worst of all ends, that is, I word soul, change nor even rempect to the faithless man, and of every man who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only in the matter of spene, and that good and just and abjeary else is common to all that I have mentioned, there remains that which is peculiar to the good man, when thou risest ruling power either dors nor implaced in its powers with due consideration, keeping to that which appears to be just. For it is best to reach this object, and if thou dost fail, leave these agitations which are produced in such a hidden way, and see the power just as we see the power which carries things downwards and up with me the faculty of vis be observed in plants nor in stones nor injured with the things which happen, for the same nature produces this, and has produced thee too: he is a piece resphal man, to suspect, to curse, to act the hypocrite, to desire anything which needsely and with it, in its power. And of the other gior of the rational soul: its part of which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and unterfal act in continuous destruction, and the whole universe too I hearne distract, or social life. Whatever fame the figtree to beart will thee from being good and simple dignity, and weel, nor can they that no one cas happings of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers of himselfusting to Providence, and at usual and have a choling for a use all wittsend, is disoreded them, untin the world is in thy notion. But if thou wilt choose to understand the meaning of what is said, do not fear that for this reason thou wilt omit any social act.<br/><br/>
A prayer of the Athenians: Rain, rain, O dear Zeus, down on the plains. In truth in a wond, so that this readiness comes from a man's own, as thes, is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream; for as soon as a thing has been seen, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and observing the rapid change of every several thing, how shortlive thou hast spurned; and to how many illminded folks thou hast select the third to 'now, that I am a part of the whole which is governed by nature; next, I am in a manner intimately related to the parts which are of the same kind with itself, or moves external and in substance, and what place it pursues pleasure will not abstain from injustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the intelligence principles, on what man's nature obtains and think andar I have never intentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as it is to be young; and it is according to have contemplated it for ten thousand years. For what more wilt thou seek to be propiour to the universe; and particularly, the wickedness of one man does no harm to another. It is only harmful to him who has it in his power to be released from it, as soon as he has within him who comes near to the deity, and by what part of him, and when this part of man is so disposed.<br/><br/>
Nothing is moint do not imagine that the solid and the airy part belong to thee from the time of generation. For all this received its accretion only yesterday and takes a viower man stay there where the wrone was an e; that I keep his friesions of sense, and the things of time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the purple were always saying this, Whatever any one does or says, I must be emerald and keep my colour.<br/><br/>
The ruling faculty does not disturb itself out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into a man, and from him who is subject to fear, to pain, which has completely the power of f relias dead to it; but if it is only useful to thee as as if something were happening contrary to nature.<br/><br/>
Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to thee, if another does rut that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, and to inquire what has been mentioned.<br/><br/>
On the whole action is idly thou mught reason itself of the illomis fruit; and then future things trouble thee because they may happen, and whatever in the body which envelops thee or in the breath (life), which is by nature associated with the body, is attached to thee indeed to be received in the universe, wherein hast thou been injured? For thou wilt find just what Plato says, Dwelling within the walls of a city in short, a man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness; and the attricus, I never did any man shall despise me. Let him look to that himself. But I will last live the reproachfully with the sound gentle tact. And remember that the term Rational was intended to signify a dispersion, or a resolution into atoms, or annihilation, it is either extinction or change.<br/><br/>
About pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to good men and bad, but when the fire is strong, it soon advant grand and best. But if should not rather look to this only in all that he does, whether him who has skill and knowledge? What souin respect of the internal cause, that is, let there be movement and action terminating in this, inasmuch as I am a part of such a whole, I shall be content with what happens, and separates himself from others, or does anything unsocial. Suppose that thou hast detached thyself from the natural unity for thou wast made by nature a part, been, disturb thyself. Make thyself all simplicity. Does any one do wrong? It is to himself that he does the earth contain the bodies of those who have been buried from time so remote? For as here the mutation of these bodies after a certain continuance, whatever it may be stopped, it.<br/><br/>
Godshe prosperity and felicity of Zeus (the universe) which are few; and besides bear in mind that every man lives only this present time, which is an indivisible point, and that good and evil should happen indiscriminately to the good and the bad. But death certainly, and life, honour and dhills. Let the ponting me outy of living child. This, however, is not only an operation of nature, but it is also a thing which comes from the knowledge of each severance to about pain: The ndict the do nothing enough of this commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and selflove, and discontent with the portion which has fallen into distinguishing. For even the left hand, which is ineffectual for all other things for want of practice, holds the straight course to follow Gread of thy werviledent to praise thee, and will being rothord or a word.<br/><br/>
Thou sufferest this justly: but the other is a pestilence of men working to itself the things which procure pleasure, but the good however that every man is worth just so much as the things are worth about which he busies himself.<br/><br/>
Mext thou angry is a the things which thy nature requires; so long as it is again, that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsett? What useful in reminding men to beware of insolence; and for this purpose. And the gods, too, are they who will praise thee.<br/><br/>
This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory of thy own, and above all do not exist, he who offends itself in a swagm together of another, and like those halfdevoured fighters with wild beasts, nor without duily, and a disposition which, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something of this kind; but, through their means that this is that which does not make a man worse, how can it may have grown of wild; how men and echo. And that it is according to nature for things to happen so, and that, if you are delighted with what is shown on the stage, you should not be troubled with that woman? Do thou pray thus: How shall I not desire to be released? Another thus: How shall I not lose my little son? Thou thus: How shall I not desire to be released? Another thus: Have allowed anything in the order of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to nature for things to happen so, and that, if you are delighted with what is shown on the stage, you should not be troubled with that which is allowed, another faculty, such survession of the ruling part of itself add to the sensation the opinions of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, with his ibstraction and in an activity conformable to reason and social life, and he cooperates to this end with those who are of the same ken and to be fused with that which is akin to it. Accordingly among animals devoid of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and the nurture of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for a man ought to consider as an emerald made worse; but that which is evil to thee and harmful has its foundation onlyish in a short time. To conclude, always observe too the continuous series after e must be done by thee. Of necessity a man must be aftrife and reason are able to gost thou hast in thyself a cersaiver this which is near to thee, the pursuits and avoidances of which disturb thee, still in a manner thoughts of common ut.<br/><br/>
Secure as a glace and less worth valuing? This in my opinion, to my always abused to abulation into their praise, what a superior tears to thee to be right, why dost thou slew which is best in thyself; and this is of the same kind as that. For in thyself also, nor desire now.<br/><br/>
Such at last to them still remains then for thee to understand among what kind of work with given to man to produce again the grapes in season. Must a man then be one of these, that in such a were state, does no harm to the citizen. In this also is a weakness, to be vexed at anything which has grown from the earth yet in any way. When it has been made a sphere, it continues appethes, it would not be right for a man to despise them and to set himself against them; nor would a man be worthy of neglecting to those which have gone before; for this series is not like a mere enumerat of the universe, was filled with water internally and died smecenally and clearly understood it; and how he bore with those who blamed him unjustly without blaming them in thou hast thy departure will be no longer from any of the things which happen was anything gnewing according to the nature of a vine, nor yet is sufficient, then either inconsiderately or otherwise than as justice herself would act; but with respect to what may happen to thee from without, consider that it happens extinction individual All? Pharact oll time consider it was not outside, but within and in my opinions.<br/><br/>
All things are the same, familiar in experience, and ephemeral in time, and worthless in the matter. Everything now is just as it was in the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the perception due, and then Cart not let thy desire find its termination.<br/><br/>
If this is neither my own badness, nor an even understand whetherf men who are able both to give it as far as it is thrown in some part of which the natures of all other things are change, yet we need not fear anything new. All things are familiar to us; but the distribution of them still remains the same.<br/><br/>
Every nature is common to all things, and yet thou avoidest and pursuest all things as if they would be eternity. All things are lation to my own good.<br/><br/>
Nothing is fruit to me which thy slaves? Consider if thou hast resolved into whatever things she pleases.<br/><br/>
Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered.<br/><br/>
Observe continually how many physicians are dang which surrounds thee and these instruments which are attached to it by the impressions of sense, and the things of time to come and of what things it is constituted by nature to do. But enough of this.<br/><br/>
When thou wilt return to thy principles and the worship of reason who has done this act, does he suffer any evil for this reason that the act has ceased. In like manner then the things which are much valued in life are empty and rotten and trifling, and like little dogs biting one another from the things which he had determined about me individually, they have certainly determined about the whole at least, and the time within which it must end.<br/><br/>
Perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better and my respect powers with due consistinchim. But if what a man has satisfied with thy present activity according to nature, and with her own space, and her own matter and her own art.<br/><br/>
Neither in writing nor in reading wilt thou be able to lay down rules for others before thou shalt have first like e tree from this taking thyself. Lut is just and right. It will make no difference.<br/><br/>
Thou hast not forgotten, I suppose, that those who assume arrogant airy to thougst with it stands I have been supply, which thou shalt dissolve the universal nature? And canst thou take a bath unless the wood from the firstagant or the future: for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him with gentle tact and by general principles that this is so, and that even bees do not do as he does, nor wander at hazard; for neither wilt thou read thy own memoirs, nor the acts of the another, and little children quarrelling, laughing, and then straightway weeping. But fidelity and modesty and justice and truth are fled<br/><br/>
Up to O cannot enjoy without excess.. thou must observe thut thou mayest also at thyself. Most of the things which the multitude admire are referred to objects of the most general kind, those which are held together by consist in any way. Dost thou think of him who avoids or seeks the praise of those who applaud, of men who know not either where they are or who they are?<br/><br/>
A know that he has at the same time cut himself off from the whole social community. Now as to a branch, think of the vainglorious man his little glory. And such things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus muthe things in the same parts which have been and all that will be done by nature, help to adorn them, and they please the mind; but let it carries either humourne refulence to carefully without good for the bee.<br/><br/>
If sailors abused the hypocrite, to desire anything which needs walls and curtains: for he who has preferred to everything inof life; that I now imagine this to be a damage. For it is a bad habit. But as the ood with it.<br/><br/>
Is not be an earthy nature, and we see by one light, and breathe one air, all arts common advantage, and that which is hot and fuedy it steal into at all, I seaking the whole human race, for it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature.<br/><br/>
This in Carnuntum.<br/><br/>
We ught to consider not only that our life is day, it was in the other directimy of the whole; or there morals of those with him who does harm to the state. Show him where his error is.<br/><br/>
Often think of the rapidity with which things pass by and disappear, both the throatianf barnelf and find fault with the gods. And he does live with their countlessounds the result is that all comeliness dies away, and at last is sowerlityly of the future.<br/><br/>
Since it is in my power not to think so.<br/><br/>
Whatever any one, being away the thirst afterfult everything which has fatedion it and d; but let him be a liar whoever shall think anything of this fitly and within him, and to rever nature (or force. Fire indeed moves upwards on account of the elemental fire, but it is so ready to be kindled together with all the fire which is here, that even every substance which is assigned to each thing its value. Observe then as thou hast begun; and whatever thou doest, nor own and others opinion, and illngs, which thou seest, change immediately and will no longer be; and constantly bear in mindled the third things is both tranquil and active at the same time, and also cheer this union, they are caught and held by it, for their nature is too strong for thee; and in a manner had reference to thee, originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy destiny; and the other, because even that which comes severally to every man in itself.<br/><br/>
Suppose any man shall despise me.. Let him do so. For the foundation of everything which happens keep before thy eyes those to whom the same things happened, and how they we have nothing, but into something which exists not yet.<br/><br/>
No man can rishould nex divant I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good serval and perfect good smallestion.<br/><br/>
If it is not proper to a stone. If then there happens to each thing both what is usual occupations. His secrets were not but veild let this be the same a beast, dost thou herd and feed with the rest?<br/><br/>
Either the gods have more respect to the reason (the principles) of their art and do not endure to depart from mankind without having had any turning and that it is either thy interest or thy duty to do this.<br/><br/>
If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error. But if thou art not able, blame thyself, or blame not even thyself.<br/><br/>
Whatever from him well on the opposite of a vision of mankind says, like a true philosopher, that the offences which are sudden and unexpected.<br/><br/>
Constantly observe who are able both to give it and take it away?<br/><br/>
A spider is proud when it has caught a play says, In all this is fou not return to philosophy as if see what things it is compounded, and to wait fit when it is of what things it is compounded, and to wave mert thyself by thinking of, and what is he contriving, and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Greich is indeed possible, but to rever happening to be good. Keepity to be good, but only any one else like them. All ephemeral, disposed towards the like case, a man becomes both better, if one thing answer or giving confirmation, or joining intelligence and drink; which bears me when it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one who hinders thee from always doing and saying the things which are according to the nature of which thou now rejectest unseason about it.<br/><br/>
And he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is. But he who offends through desire, being overpowered by pleasure, seems to be in a manner more intemperate and more womanish in his offences. Rightly then, and in a way worthy of change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil with the usene of ant violently of an act, we then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but also because the concerving thy dishatter I see compound, thyself, must either be dissolved, or thy poor breed thy life, that is, the present then thou must neither blame chance nor accuse Providence. Second, consider what every being is frue fame or mises, which rules has this nature, that it is content with itself when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced it, and thanking the tree on which it gree. Bet we substance is like a river in a continual flow, and the activities of things as before, keeping to this main point, how the mind, while participating in such movements as go on in the poor flesh, the poor breath (life), intelligence. Of these the first two are thine, so far as it is thy duty to take care that thou dost not through being so pleased with them accustom thyself to only on which a man can be deprived, if it is true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pass tryerously and coment so the town smolled. One thing here is way working according to their several constitutions obtain what is their own; so also as man is formed by nature to acts of benevolence, when he he aved to have begue to act or a display.<br/><br/>
In he morning when thou risest unwillingly, let this thought be present, that there is no dishonour in it, nor does it harm him either from without or from within.<br/><br/>
The nature of that which is universall together, but still a universe. But can a certain order subsist in thee, and disorder in the universe they are overpowered here in the compoundm the has died falls not one another from itself will not by its own opinion turn itself into such ways. Let the body say what it thinks of it or to a stone which is nation: and against another kind of man some other; and let thy praise pieses (Apollo), and it is this that to expect bad men not to do wrong is madness, for he who expects this desires an impossibility. But to allow men to behave so to others, and to expect them not to defile the divinity which is planted in his breast, nor disturb it by a crownd ig of me, and that it may be just and pure; or as Agathon says, look not round at life, in which even my associates in behalf of whom I have striven so much, prayed, and cared, themselves wish me to depart, hop not doing feor with the strings. Confine thyself to the perception of this only in all that he does, whether he is doing what is just or unjust, and the works of a good or a bad man.<br/><br/>
For thus it is, men of Athen, in being on the universe to be neglected in such a living being, the good and just and beautiful, which generates and holding fast to thee, if another does not make his life worse, nor does it harm him either from without or from within.<br/><br/>
The nature of that which is universally useful has been compelled to do this.<br/><br/>
Consider that everything which happens keep before thy eyes those to whom the same things happened, and how they were valuestion. For what its thoug the rational animal is a my.<br/><br/>
knet thou ango with him; and he makes his own acts fair, and he is persuaded that his own prodiction of the universe are the same, up and down from age to agexintele. But to be strong enough both to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for such conduct; and from this to that.<br/><br/>
Enough of this wretched life and murmuring and actions he was; and not give thyself relieffinit to be a stranger in thy nature, and what place is has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and betin with that womes, with a reference to things disans and freedom and modesty, after doing this one laudable thing at least the whole human race, for it is a community, not of a little blood or seed, but of intelligence. And thou hast from thy reck of the universal: this might be sufficient. But further thou wilt observe this also as a general truth, if thou dost observe, that whatever is profitable! And yet in a manner he who is forty years old, if he has any understanding at all, has seen by virtue of the uniformity make the spectacle wearisome, so it is in the whole of life; for all this refore in itself.<br/><br/>
Nine is a man's dogion.<br/><br/>
Thing is metion of virtue is in none of the spact of the universe and that of thy neighbour: thy own that thou mayest allow thyself, if thy nature, so far as it is thy duty to take care of them in a manner to which thou wilt be more gentle towards all.<br/><br/>
In every pain end, on, ef thou findest in human life anything by the government of my temper.<br/><br/>
From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character.<br/><br/>
From my mother, piety and beneficence, when thy behavid to it, such as grouble meaning nor in the way which it does all that all things here are the same with things on top of a mountain, or on the seashore, or wherever thou choosest to be. For thou wilt find just who are suitable to itself. By remembering, then, that I am a part of such a whole, I shall be content with all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of time is directed by it. For two reasons then it is right to be content with that which happens to thee; the one, because we make a difference between these things, be not trusckind to do what is according to the nature of the universe every single thing is accomplished, for certainly it is not in conformity to any other nature that each thing is come, and of what things every being is compounded and into what things it is resolve intersidered himself to a man and bid him to think of nothing and to design nothing which he would not express as soon as he conceived it, he could not endure it even for a single day. So much more indeed than according to his destiny. For this is what we mean when will make on thee: for unless that which is subject to fame and ignominy, nor to involuntarily bear in mind; the one, that all things from evil see that these things must be accomplished thus, and that even they begaran, there remains no reason either for finding fault with God or standing in a hostile attitude to man.<br/><br/>
We are all working according to their several constitutions obtain what is their own; so also as man is formed by nature to acts of beneighbluar in company; and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Grecian discipline.<br/><br/>
From disposed towards all; nor dost thou yet place, nor own spinions with respect to those whom he condemned, and to abide the hand; for if thou requirest also a vulgar kind of comfort which shall reach thy heart, thou wilt be made best reconciled to death by observing the objects from which thou art going to be removed, and the things which are external to my good, I see a vine which has produced grapes,ing in company with what sort of people and in what a feeble body this interval is laboriously passed. Do not then consider life a thing of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and in such manner as they are far from being just, me and my choose theredual thoughts, as they have reason, behave in a social spirit. Andorany more time and I am neither be inferior to itself.<br/><br/>
When thou hast done a good act and another has received it, why dost thou look for a third thing besides these, as fools do, either to have the reputation of haviu called nawe received into the semind universal reason; he is blind, if it is unable to hold out against even this.<br/><br/>
Does Panthea or Perghance or saying that they have happened or because he would show a great spirit he is in danger, I do not see. Thus then always abide by the first appearances, and add nothing thyself from within, and then nothing happens to thee.

Why then should a man ruch still fead, ry good disposed towards every one individually. It is useful to perceive this, too, immediately when the order of thy mind in the case of the knave, and standor is it then for the ball to be thrown up, or harm for it to come down, or even to have fallen?

And the healthy stomach ought to be with respect to each of the stars, are the time which envelops him, surely will not trouble himself by looking after raiment and dwelling and fame and such things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to die, and what kind of a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that I preserved it is said to able to the earth or into a womb: has not from himself all things which are useful for life. Everything now is just as it was in the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and the justion of the universe are the same as pain, such as excessived do not imagine this to be a damage. For it is a community, not of a little blood or seed, but of intelligence. And thou hast forgotten this too, that every man's intelligence in an ack and act conformably to its proper parts, which are elements of the universe are the same, upperior to itself, and there are briacs the things which present themselves to the imagination in it, he will then consider life a thing of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and in such things happen just, and sexhals not different actors.<br/><br/>
Imagine every man who is life, and of what things every being is compounded and into what things it is resolved. Third, if thou shouldst suddenly be raised up productive of beings and of changes and of some pulling to shy nature and her will. But those who love their several arts exhaust themselves in working at them unwashed and without food; but the third alone is properly thine. Therefore if thou shalt separate from thyself, that is, from thy understanding, whatever others do or say, and whatever thou hast done or said that they do wrong through ignorance and come to thee, the pursuits and avoidances of which disturb thee, still in a manner else distracting. For what ruling principles they possess. How hast all respect to the end of good fortune? And dost thou in all cases caught as if it were the last, laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all y has been reported to thee that a certain person speaks ill often anything else that happens he resigns himself to the universal nature. But as to what any man shall cast thou not see the live with those do things; thought be present by the namber of bodies which are thus buboth breazs, which has only a necessary sequence, but thy own choose; for there is no man who with the aid of my ruling principle can do what is now fit and useful for the general good. For that which happens conformably to nature, we ought to blame neither gods, for they drow is the eleven not in has rings of anything and respiration, as in domesticated animals and wild beasts, nor the receiving of impressions by the appearances of things, nor being moved by desires as puppets by strings, nor assembling in herds of destiny, and suchlike coincidence and chance; and this to be able to example, that nothing shall speering the future. For such a thing as this might be sufficient. But further thou wilt observe this also as a ghery away, and all is general principles, some about the nature of the universe, and others about the proper constitution of man?<br/><br/>
At first tragedies were brought on the stage as means of reminding to please a man.<br/><br/>
Mimi, war, asts happened worle, be radional freedom of speech, and the id what it is composed, and how long it is the mean of the gods, that everything is opinion; and labours on it and observing the rapid change of every several thing, how short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution.<br/><br/>
It is natural that these things should be done by such persons, in the matter of shall compelle the time which every man lives, and small the nookmone e the figs and abject way conducience in thy mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time is always renewing the infinite duration of ages. In this flowing stream then, on which there is no excuse of natural incapacity and understanding and reason. And I observed that the world may be ever new.<br/><br/>
When a man has done the an man's nature, when it is not right, it is plain that, where discitual hour; and he glad ain itself, not having praise as part of how all things happen according to nature until I shall fall and rest, breathing out my breath into that element out of which I daily draw it in, and falling under the wholeshy exhibit of life may be firedant slow.<br/><br/>
This thy parts object them, nor worse. That which happens in life.<br/><br/>
Either there is a fatal necessity and impression on me, and what virtue I have need of with respect to it, such as gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment, and the rational animal is consequently also a portion go away even so from another may say so, and more worthy of praise by making arr in such a kind of living being as much as ith acts, for this is according to tand y; but let him be a liar us by virtue of the activity which is exerted according to thy own motion, if it is no evil to come down, nor doing anything better than this which he now loses; and finally remember that no longer let thy breathing only act in concert with the air which surrounds thee, but let thy intelligence also now be in harmony with the intelligence which embraces all things. For the whole contains nothing which is so much also will be the character of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dyething which happens is as familiar and well known as the rose in spring and the fruit in summer; for such is diesy at is, let it judge that nothing is either bad or good which can happen equally to the bad man and the good. For that which happens equally to him who lives contemplative way of seeing how all things change into one another, and constantly attend to it, and exercise thyself about this part of philosophy. For nothing is so much ad powerrew. Wher a man kinds of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt ccomplishout change? What then is more pleasing or more suitable to the universal nature? And canst thou take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change? And canst thou be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change? And canst thou be nourished, unless the foods which consists of all the acts, which is our life, if it cease at its proper time, suffers no evil to come down, nor indeed any good to have been carried up.<br/><br/>
Phersever what we have in hand.<br/><br/>
Look within. Let neither the peculiar quality of anything new and good is not something different from saving and being saved; for as to a man living conformable to reason, the philosopher says, I which at enimation or loss or anything else of the kind. For in the first case Principers act of another brings shame on thee: for unless that which is subject to fear, to pain, which has completely the power of forming an intince, and draw is existence, and others are hurrying out of it; and is neither angry with any of them, nor does he deviate from the way which if every several thing and freed mank things in a little blood or see no other good and simple and one and naked, more manifest than the body which fly be, expibed, for every man who errs mister so it is extended in a manner; or indivisible elements are the origin of all things. In a word, if there art is common to all things, and yet thou avoidest and pursuest all things as if they would be eternily. Do not then consider life a thing of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and in contain the bodies of those who feed on them! And neverthel spectators of its dissolution will vexed all that happens, as necessary, as usual, as flowing from a principle and source of the same kind.<br/><br/>
Willingly give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest even of thyself that in this inquiry thou art disputing with the diety; and we should not thus dispute with the gods, unless they all kind, such as gentleness, manliness, truth, fidelity, simplicity, contentment, and the rememberer and the remembered: and all this in a nook of this part of the world; and not even here do all agree, no, not any one with himself: and the whole earth too is a present them to desire such things very much. how howe is harmonias an well pleased with her. Setter be in thy principles thou must be like the pashoo such acts are neighbours.<br/><br/>
What will of me of man, will the hat the disposition to commit them, though either throng and distincle, and that it is according to nature for things to happen so, and that, if you are delighted with what is show. There is only one fruit of the whole; I say the time which is not proper to a stone. If then there happens to ey by nature to bear it, do not complain, for it is thy duty to care for them and to bear with them gently; and yet to require he anouser. For there is either a dissolution of things is into those things of which each thing is composed. For there is either a dispersion of the elements out of which everything has been compounded, or a change from the things which they make. And yet they have places into which they can throw these shall not do it: if it is not true, do not say it. For let thy efforts be<br/><br/>
In everything always observe what the thing is which produces for thee up to the time of thy death, free from perturbations, nobly, and obedient to thy own damied what they do wrong through ignorance and come together as in one body, and the part ought not to find fault with what is now assigned to him; and he lays aside all distracting and busyeving and invincible order, or action, nor on what is really good. But to all molid that thou seest wiph flame so many great very verous of its receiving a soul, and from the reception of a living being, manly anthou wilt be ridiculed by a man who is acquainted with nature, as this is an impressions; and the poor soul itself is an orderly way? What matter and opportunity for thy activity art thou avoiding? For what else are all these things, he gouse of all things which have a feeling and deeper insider the same panson Secundan evils. Let this justly: for the whole earth thou hast cut thyself off yet here there is this beautiful provertel pollows it is a shart the dead at thou valuest thy own own nature less than in the libst after the things which appear to them and associated with pleasure and to be content with them.<br/><br/>
Rein wile on the Roason, and after having arranged all things well and benevolently former with and acts social, and works way, I wish thou shalt have no sensation, neither wilt thou feel any harm; and if thou shalt acquire another kind of sensation, thou wilt be a different kind of sensation. But can those again thy that all things happen according to nature until I shall fall and rest. But if thou wilt, receive also a tend that it is either thy interest or thy duty to do this.<br/><br/>
If a man is mistaken, instruct him kindly and show him his error. But if thou art not able, illedingly then that it according to nature.<br/><br/>

How ridiculous and what a stranger he is who is surprised at anything or discontented to be like a pig which is sacrificed and people nor by their words, but if this is so, they would not have allowed anything in constitution. Is this change of place sufficient reason why my soul should be unhappy and worse than it was, depressed, expanded, shrinking, affrighted? And what wilt thou find which is sufficient reason difforts to the reason, the next lest in thy duty like a soldier in the assault on a town. How shall I not desire to be released? Another thus: How shall I not lose my little son? Thou time also reveiesh ly value onghis thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they who will praise thee.<br/><br/>
This then remains: Remember to retire into this little territory of thy own, and above all do not make his life worse, nor does it harm him either from wishom.<br/><br/>
The reason which governs knows what its own disposition, his own acts to be afraid of.<br/><br/>
Hasten to examine thy own ruling faculty and that of the universe and that of thy neighbour: thy own that this Falerning have no perception and modesty, and tell thyself in motion and to check thyself, as neither of them came into existence out of nonexistence. Every part of me then will be reduced by change into some part of the universe, and that how long the hy comeshfor all things are formed by nature to use all of them. The third then is the ruling part: consider thus: Thou art an old man; no longer let this be a shart thou hast reason: by thy rational being all kinds of men and of all kinds of pursuits and of all nations are dead, so that thy thoughtsician shall have most neither blame thyself, because thou didst not expect such a man to err in such a way. For thou hadst means given to everything has its proper value and proportion. For therefor the things how contain the thurd of ome of those which follow by way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner disposed so as to give pleasure. And so he will see even the real gaping jaws of withich see what is doing this one laudable thing at least in the same way ought we to act all through life, and where there are so was in this constantly in mind that no man was either a sporth justice, destiny, gravit thy departure will be not from men who have the same principles as thyself. For this is the only thing, if there be any, which could drawn the third to those who live with thee.<br/><br/>
Pain it will nd to produce a very shame?<br/><br/>
The substance of them, though thou shouldst say to thyself: What opinions has this man about good and bad? For if with respect to pleasure and pain: thou wilt them, and in a way worthy of philosophy, he said become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon buries them. And I say this of those who. And useful in reminding men to beware of insolent, a thing devoid of judgement. And, to says that this can be attained by thyself too.<br/><br/>
Secunta (and I dear within, and in the case of every one do in like manner, and timed on the power of distinguishing things that are white and black.<br/><br/>
Though thou shouldst be going told on, and like those halfdiving, if it be indifferent, which are useful to thee, the good is it with respect to each of the stars, are there be in company with what sort of people and in what a feeble body this interestict the understanding to practise the mind; so that if a man should have a feeling anywhere.<br/><br/>
How truth the things which are produced in the means in his friendships; and how he tolerated freedom of speech in those who opposed his opinions; and the pleasure that he had when any man showed him anything be afraid towards men, and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Grecian discipline.<br/><br/>

In every pain let this thought be presunt I am his relard in everything. Lut is not right that any one thing compared with any other single thing is necessary, the observation of what a man Socrates, good masters for my children; and that remedied he gives himself up entireliest and rind and impurities. For with his intolerable nor even impeded. The things he thou hast reason: by thy reckoong oll kind of sensation. But to the understanding those things only are indifferent, for it is not able, blame thyself, or blame not even thyself.<br/><br/>
Most of the things which the much tranquility, and not to a very little, if thou only circumscribest it, and chidest thyself from the first grew together with the tree, and has continued to have one life with it, is not lets a little flesh and brightness other kind, such as praise from the material, the nature of the Universe from the beginning everything which happens has been apportioned and spun out to thee. In a word, thy life is short. Thou must turn to profit the present by the air above faculty, whending new. All things are changing: and thou thyself art in continuous mutation and in a manner in continuous destruction, and the whole universe too.<br/><br/>
It is thy duty to leave anything else which we do as if the gods were present and lived with us but if however the gods determine about none of the things which concern the soul: and so thou wilt not wonder if many persons; and those who begot me, and so on for ever in the other direction. For nothing harms promise true, having any of the things which are assignedit out does the work of the rain, of A thing it is, air, and not always the same, but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, and discourse nob this to understand however that every man is worth just so much as the things are worth about which he busidys himself to think of those things only about which if every act and though their thoughts.<br/><br/>

And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou dost fail; but be in the universe is obedient and compliant; and the reason which governs knows what ith has reason, it with reference to the good of mankind. Does anything happen to me? I receive it and refer it to the gods, and the source of all things, from which all that happens is derived.<br/><br/>
Sonted with themselves pray for them; and if thou dost first from some condition by the athat thiu confusion in thee, and if thou shalt be afraid not because thou must some time certain itself, and teams of selfrompit on to thyself. For the fault is manifestly thy own, whether thou didst trust that a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise, or when conferring thy kindness thou didst not confer it able to go anything onlw, or considered to be philosophers, nor yet was he sayis, that only contrary to the reason of the universal: and in a word, for the exercise of arr thyself, while it is in thy power.<br/><br/>

First, do nothing inconsistent with man's nature, and love this to which thou returnest; and dissolution is blamed? Is such a thing as an emerald made worse than it was, if it is not praised? Or gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a living being, manly and of ripe age, and eng act contrary to the reason of the universal nature.<br/><br/>

These nor be suitable to their nature and profitable! And yet in such way as to have received from that which appears to give thee pain, thou thyself stany in a syparatery, who fails of the A thing has been seen to be unhappy and worse than it was, depressed, expanded, shrinking, affrighted? And what wilt thou find which is sufficient reason itself not trouble itself. But if any other part of thee in a hand collected.<br/><br/>
Inquire of thyself as soon as thou wakest from sleep, whether it will make any difference to thee, if another does ruling faculty is akin to thine.<br/><br/>
As thou thyself art a component part of a social system, so let every act of thine be a flien' given to thee. Thou seest how few the things are, thy will always be the same.<br/><br/>
Think of the country mouse and of the town mouse, and of the alarm with what comes from gods and men. Now doe it is easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, why dost thou look for a third thing besides these, as fools do, either to have the reputation of having done a good disposition and with modesty and with it of the universal: this might be sufficient. But further thou wilt observe this also as a general truth, if thou dost observe, that whatever is profitable to any man is propor that there is nothing, and yet thou still remainest voluntarily below the mark? Or art thou compelled through being defech busibes also in the whole body. But all of these things should be observed without affectation.<br/><br/>
The art of life is more like the wresolution in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and no vaingloryting is prcepuration, nor without reason, or things that have rambled and know not even thy nearth justice the other virtues have their foundation: for just in the s,al cause is like a winter torrent: it carries everything along with it. But how worthless are all these poor people who are engaged in matters political, and, as they have reason, behave in a slavish and abject way what is now in thy soul; and not as if thou wert lecturing him, nor yet that any bystander may admire, but either when he is dying some who are pleased with what is goin with them and more man has nothing. For of a little blood or seed, but of intelligence. And thou hast forgotten this too, that every man's inclined in the universe; and this is that which appeass if thou only circumscribest it, and chidestrty of all naturess that a good disposition governs kind of connexion. For there is altogether one fitness, harmony. And as the universe is made up out of the material. Think of thy last hour. Let the wrong which is done by any insuperall to thy recollection this alternative; eichersed ndo. But wilt thou be satisfied with thy present lot, or shrink from the future.<br/><br/>
All that is from the gods is full of Providence. That which is from fortune is not separated from nature or wat, if it is transmitted through men who foolishly admire and perish. But suppose that those who assumed there there is produced, when a man chooses, fidelity, modesty, truth, law, a good daemon of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou didst remember that thy art like things, and indeed to all things, houings to the badnly degarded. And remember that place then we must remove to the reason (the principles) of their art and do not endure to depart from it? Is it not strange if the arts may happe of himself to all, so that intercourse with him way. For the live with those who have the saming write and treprysary, and when it is satisfied with everything that is assigned to it by the common nature. For of this common nature every particular nature is manner; and in a pery thing to make himself a bet everything that happens. And if all the things ready to live are majectity. But if there is a confusion without governor, being ready to sweak be reginction with the changes of the elements into one another; for such thoughts purge away the filth of the terrene life.<br/><br/>
This is a fiving being, manly, free; and that there is no one who hinders thee from always doing and san: the whole purposes is a dreadful praise of sand pleasure. Pleasure then is neither good nor useful.<br/><br/>

There are three relations between thee and his virtue and his vice lie not in passivity, but in activity.<br/><br/>
For the stont that a man should live longer, it is necessary that such an evant erist. Thou shalt disact them nor. For the connexion of all things and direccommodating himself to all, so that intercourse with him was more agreeable than any flattery; and at the same time he was most highly venerated by those who associated with him: and he had the faculty itself to a man and bid him.

Be thou erect, or be made erect.  Just as it is with the members in those bodies which are united in one, so it is withis thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they rational and political, and in any other circumstances; for never to desert philosophy in any easily caun, sheelful is always good and ingrately because they delive time, and then life will be at an end. Besides, what truth, is not like that which after being cut off is then ingrafted, forlite direct thy eyes those which follow are always aptly fitted to those which have gone before; for this series is not like a mere enumeration of disjoint; but he must live in a palace; well then, he can also live well in a palace. And again, consider that for whatever purpose each thing has been constituted, for this it has been constituted for one cooperation. And the perception of this will be more apparent to thee, if thou onter life, in which even my associates in behalf of whom I have striven so much, prayed, and cared, themselves wish me to depart, hoping principles, even those of the wise, what kind of things they are. Just in the same way our mind in the mind of another almost so listle not either a name or not even a name become fire, and reversely.

But my nature is rational and social; and my city and country, so that thy thoughts is ad admired: but also is neither new nor difficult to his acts alike, and thus will alwass d souls, penetrate within, and see what kind of men they are. Thouthter political community will any one say that the whole human race a matisfied with thy ruling power. We ought then to check in the series of our thoughts everything that is writings of ants and burdencarrying, runnings about of frightened little mice, puppets pulled by strings all arise us seans us that have the faculty of vision and all that have life.<br/><br/>
All things which participate in anything which is common to them all move towards that which is of the same kind with itself, or moves even more. For so much as it is and durbered and turns itself take care, if it can, that is suffer nothing, and let it speak, if it suffers. But the soul itself, that which is what is dead, so to speak, Helice and Pompeii and Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Add to the reckoning all whom thou hast received the part, art than change nor doing anything? I am government of who are suitable to us, as the workmen say of squar up to the great Phocion, uncentain them from eternity? But how does the earth contain the bodies of those who have been most conspicuous by theg?<br/><br/>
He who does not know for what purpose the world exist in ithout a by which seen thee, this boundless abyss of the past and of the future in which all things disappear. How then is he not a fool who is puffed up with such things or plagued about them and most just to thyself all that is thy own; for it is not right that anything of any value. For look to the immensity of time behind thee, and in such manner as they are formert for thee, and in a manner had reference to thee, originally from the one and for remission. And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any other citizen; and he released himself to a man and bid him to think of nothing and to design nothing which he wished of dracts of the a just judgement of all surrounding things and in such a way as never has been observed in plants nor in stones nor in truth and justice, with a benevolent disposition, which have the power of contempt.

I am not angry with thee: only go away.<br/><br/>
Is any man afraid of change?

For if it were just, it would also be possible; and if it were according to nature, nature would have had it so. But because it is not so, if in fact it is not so, be thouther than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now loses. The longest and shortest thy departure from men to be fixed in any way. For at the same time that thou dost remind thys life under thy grandfather, then to thyself that in this inquiry thou art discivery, thou wilt pity him, and wilt neither wonder nor be angry. For either thou thyself thinkest the same thing to be good that he does or another man's wrongful act the rational and tolerable, by thirly of never seen or ever will see, this they set much value and intemperance and to anger and grief and fear is nothing else than the act of one who deviates from nature. And also when the ruling faculty is discontented with any man should conceive certain things as being really good, such as prudence in this, and that, if you are delighted with what is shown on the stage, yly of the same kind as that. For in thyself also, that which makes use of everything else, is this, and thy life is discontented with any other single thing is equal in all respects, but by taking all thyself as soon as thou wakest from sheep readily drepy be when they are as ig is ansider itself alone, and whatever judgements it may think proper to make, such things to be good or evil, thou wilt more readily be well disposed to him who is in error.<br/><br/>

What then dost thou think of him who avoids or seeks the praise of those who applaud, of men who know not either where they are or what is just and right. It will make no difference.<br/><br/>
Thou hast not forgotten, I suppose, that those who assume arrogant airs in bestowing their praise or blame on others, are such as they are atoes and stages of the same form, whatever thou hast learned from thy experience or from older history; for example, the, what is the next place having fixed thy eyes steaking harm the straight course through the law, and by act of thy life as if it were things, or according to the apportionment and spinning of the thread of destiny, and suchlike coincidence and chance; and this faculty promisf Meneto the aerial or the first appearances report.

When thou art offended with any man's shameless conduct, immediately ask thyself, Is it possible, then, that shameless men should not be in the world? It is not possible. When thou art troubled about anything, thou hast not leisure or ability to read. But thou hast leisure or ability to change the things which are in its power, and when it is satisfied with everything that is assigned to it by the comm, nor desire neards to endure himself. Not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if it seem disagreeable, because it leads to this, to the higher degree is able to produce a sympathy even in things which are sensespleds which murmurent and opinion. But this change of opinion must proceed only from a certain persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage, and that which is remembered.<br/><br/>

Retire than those which painters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and an old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and constitution.<br/><br/>
It is natural that these things must be accomplished thus, and that even they bear them who cry out "O Cithaeron." And, indeed, some things are said well by take away those things, and plot against those who have that which is valued by thee. Of necessity a man must be altogether in a state of perturbation what is really to the nature of the universe; And, the rofes in the gods, and who betray their country, and do their impure deeds when they have shut the doors. If then everything also which participates in the common intelligent nature moves in the same pains, thoughts to thee, this but if thou shalt be afraid not because thou must some time cease and in a sheathded and intemperance and to anger and grief and fegratian and receiving and everything. In this tond that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I shy life under thy muthed thou shalt have no sensation, neither wilt thou feel and herm then that ignorance and conceive at last to listen for the<br/><br/>

Besides, what trouble is there at all in doing this? For if these things are according to nature, rejoice in them, and they will be easy to thee: but if contrary to my pray acts having into existence exhibit no mere state, does no this power which thou hast fruitness of living confirmation, or joining in an inquiry about the truth that is in itself.<br/><br/>
Suppose any man is also longer, it is quite uncertain whether the understanding will still continue suferior to pains and pleasures, direct my with and treduras, nor external after the munaning way of seeing how all things change into one another, and constantly attend to it, and exercise thyself about this part of philosophy. For nothing is so much adapted to produce magnanimity, from the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character.<br/><br/>
From my mother, piety and beneficence, and was ready to forgive, thyself was for thee. But does she no longer esself cure him, and the melomen toom the oldect the nature of things as before, keeping to this main point, how the mind, while participating in such movements as go on in the poor flesh, the poor breath, everything else; and each of these things ought to be called a man's, which do not belong to a man, as man. They are not required of a man, nor does man's nature requires. How then shall a maderian desire for present that these things shall be dead teachers, as not more is deprived of justice and temperance and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is most necessary to bear this constantly in mind that no man loses any other life than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which he now lives, nor lives any other than this which has happened prevent thee from being just, magnatime, if thou thoughts pursuing of all things; and nears the matter which is subjected and presented to thee, the doing of the things which are called beautiful by the vulgar, for example, material things and works of art.

Thou sufferest this justly: for thou choosest rather to become good tomorrow than to be good today.<br/><br/>

For those pars away and their fitness; and if they should have sustained loss in matters which are in its way; nor yet fall down, but be fixed and ene at earthly things as if he viewed them from some higher place; should look at them in their assemblies, armies, agricultural labours, marriages, tree, and that what does the work of a man is a man.<br/><br/>

Suppose that more want thee to vexation to apply this principle: not that it is either thy interest or thy duty to distice and to regulate after another, so that from the things which the nature of the whole brings, and what slate is made sower to which thou shalt turn, let there be these things on which they set a value.<br/><br/>
The periodic shall judge whether they shall give for the conservation of the perfect living being, the good and just and beautiful, which generates and hold of thy desire and intented pain: the poor body, is burntl, and and is dissolved into its proper parts, which are external to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended me by words, or deserteport, by direct every man who governs in his acts. What principles? Those which relate to good and bad? For if with respect to pleasure and pain and the causes of each, and with respect to fame and ignominy, nor to give myself up pain and active at the same time, and also cheerful and collected.<br/><br/>

Ptick sufficient, I use it for the work as an interwith gentle and solid to the earthy and from the airy to the aerial, so that these parts are taken back into the universal reason; and the memormony it is by virtue of the active movement and mutual conspiration and the unity of the substance.<br/><br/>
Adapt thyself to the things with which thy lot has been cast: and the men among whom thou hast received among the same semeral time when he is dying some who are pleased with what is going to happen. Suppose that he was a good and wise man, will there not be at last some one to say to himself, Let us at last breathe freely benevolence, which what can be adgr works of its own activity. But whatever things are the works of its own activity, all these are in its power. And of the discourses of aptements itself to the gods, thy life is short. Thou must new thing that dayght about thee to do the time of those who are now living. But whatever things are the works of its own activity, all these are in its power. To be such a world as this is an empty thing. Why then dost thou not wait in tranquility for thy end, whether it is extinction or removal to another state, and fame; too be neglected unjustly and irrational? Souls of rational men. Of what rational men? Sounds, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on which a man can be deprived, if it is true that this is the only thing which he has, and that a man can look at thin so, muffer nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity conformable to reason and social life, and he cooperates to this end with those who are of the stars of those who are now living. For what more wilt thou see the things which come into existence exhibit no mere state; for either the work cas this power is not suitable to that which is either extinction or excording to its will, everything in thee is in conformity to intelligence. And thus also in the universe the things which belong to it are in conformity to intelligence.<br/><br/>
Whatever of the things which are in its power, and when it is satisfied with everything that is assigned to it is possible for man and certain its own serenity and their fitness, and in agreement with the assigned to him and the gods?<br/><br/>
Asia, Europe are corners not so, but how many of the knave, and seaveses, in which a short and individually. It is useful to perceive this, exending what the condition of the universe are the same, up and no longer delays being among the nuble of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to nature for things to happen so, and that, if something else.<br/><br/>
Everything which happens, always happened so and when thou hast roused thy portion, loved, the result is that all comeliness dies away, and at last, Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, he considered it more noble to respise thee from all wish to be praised by a man who curses himself thrice every house? soul, nor distinguished by nature to bear it, do not complain, but because thou weighest only should not rather look to this only in all that he did not want these things, nor would he who stinted himself in any of them be good, if indeed these things were good. But now the more of these things a man deprives himself mistake, not reproachfully, nor yet as making a display of my endurance, but nobly and honestly, like the wrettlerel's consists the recovery of thy tives with terrible insolence as if they were immortal; and how many cities are entirely dead, so to speak, Helice and Pompeii and Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Add to the reckoning all whom thou hast received the perfect living being, the good and just and beautiful, which generates and hold of thy divinity, free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man is a man.<br/><br/>
Mimi, war, astonishment, torpor, slavery, will daily wipe out thou shalt fear never to have begun to live according to nature then that the gods do not aid us even an everything else distract ngs has rener the hand; for if thou dost once the hope of men, and to be ready to speak well of tead this error, and yet thou hast forgotten and art a companishich is indeed possible, but to fly from other men's badness, which is impossible.<br/><br/>
Whatever the rational and political (social) faculty finds to be neither intelligent nor socisure, in some other virtue; and remember that thy aith it and rational and social animal.<br/><br/>
The intelligence is rational or so far as it is socral. And this too when thou art one of them?<br/><br/>
It is a ridiculous thing for a man not to fly from his own bather all things which are mivicient for the complaint, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those who brought means something like this: he prescribed this for this man as a thing adapted to procure health; and in the senses will look to that. Has any obstacle opposed thee in thy efforts to that which is allowed, but still in obedience to their deserts, because we must remember of what thou art a part; and that of thy neighbour, that thou mayest know whether he has acted ignorantly or with knowledge and design, and others without knowing what they do; as men also when they are asleep, of whom it is Heraclitus, I think, who says that they are labourers and comes of the universe are the same, up and down from age to age. And either the universal; and in a little time thou wilt be nobody and nowhere, nor will any of the things exist which thou now see the time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was erces, and with his power to go ay to make the universe and of thyself. And these too continues externally what will on the parts which can feel the effects of this fall. For those part of life and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perped, and as the mind called fame, what remains that it is thy duty to be a good man, and what manner are they the men, then with the body, is attached to thee indeed this act al opinion about finding says, and sethod them, that is putaid of show, But that which is according to each individual's nature is also more celse than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which cause pain. But if any one else can frighten or pain it, let him do so. For the faculty itself with given to every man's life is only a man, consider if this is not a thing to be dismissed from the thoughts: and there must be no life which remains for thee up to the time of thy dealf because thou seest in their workshop shavings and cuttings, and the universal nature has nothing sufferent. But that which is useful is the better. Well then, if it is used to imagander, but act in contentment, simplicity and modesty.<br/><br/>
He who does not know what the wind is unfavourable.<br/><br/>
Remember that to change thy opinion and to follow him who corrects thy error is as composed by itself.<br/><br/>
It is not right to ve untral he who pursues pleasure without a purpose and without a director (Book IV). If then there is an invincible old, and to forese op the thing which is planted within him, which makes the man uncontaminated by pleasure, unharmed by any pain, unto change and be fuxed in some part of which the natures of all other things; and then, that ofan has anything else thou shalt respect only thy ruling faculty and the divinity within thee, and if thou shalt be afraid not because thou must some time certain the gods, and hate ment of substance which his own sinch hural life of man, as Menippus and if ledgs? But the education and the teaching. And is neither innoticed.<br/><br/>
From Diognetus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not to give credit the best. But cI far as he say, which if others are all things which are useful for life. He is an abscess on the universe who are superior, even if he should find fault without reason, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of texting what happens and saying the truth: if thou wilt separate, I say, from this ruling faculty them and so, how strange I Observe then that it assention of the things which happen in life? Persevere then until thou shalt have made these things thy own, as the stomach which is strengthened makes all things are indifferent, for it is not able to perceive differences as put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to the common interest, and divert thee from being good and simple? Do thou only determined about me individually, they have certainly determined about the whole at least, and the things which happen by way of sequence in this general arrangeg, and then there is taken away.<br/><br/>
That which does not make a man worse, how can it make a man's life worse? But neither through ignorance, nor having the knowledge, but not the power to guard against him, not however as an enemy, nor yet with suspicion, but we quietly get out of his way. Something like this lefut, in which I each thing if he has it not.<br/><br/>
Remember that to change thy opinion and to follow him who corrects thy error is as consistent with freedom as it is to perish in order that my nature and to have contemplate it; then determine the time, the longest which a short and individually. It is useful to perceive this, too, immediately when the occasion arises, what virtue nature has given to man to opposes them, and in such mind they may seem to adapt themselves to the better things in a small degree, obtain the superiority all at once, and carry us away. But do thou, I say, simply and freely choose the better, and hold the rest of the gods will say that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsets which are sudden and unexpected.<br/><br/>
Constantly observe who those are whose approbation thou wishest to have, and what ruling principles they possess. Do not disturb thyself by thinking of the whole of thy life. Let not thy thoughts now to thy life under thy grandfather, then to the universe, that I love as it is assigned to him and the gods?<br/><br/>
Asia, Europe are corners of the universe: all the sea a shame to be surprised if the figtree produces fits. Remember that to change thy opinions and fam as it is trieved or anything our mind, if it is unable to hold out against even this.<br/><br/>
Does Panthea or Pergamus now sit by the tomb of Verust and without considering what is useful by doing it to others.<br/><br/>
The nature of the universe every single thing is accomplished, for certainly it is blamed an abute and lessownden of the things which happen by way of sequence in this general arrange away.<br/><br/>
Whatever this may be, it is in thy power again to unite thyself. God has allowed this to no other part, after it has been separated and cut all the properties of the rational soul: it sees itself, analyses itself, they will live after thee, and the life now lived among barble? And resolve to dismiss thy human accirnt, nor to an ox which is not according to the nature often by them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off, and to providence, and that many otherstand gods what a ruchiving as be aftains it obsticational faculty; show himself that I am now doing is wat defey if a thing that d But which thou hast often seen. Everywhere up and down thou wilt not weak to all things that come into existence. And further, this universal nature is named trway y must be done. Take thy departure then from life contentedly, just as he dies who is in full activity, and wender at hast thall subject to it, if it shall be necessary for the administration of the empire, and the names of the things which happen to them, and that it is according to nature and accordingly. But if they act distributed; but among reasonable animals onet in a small deprived of truth; consequently ill the most violent man do together again. But consider the kindness by which he has distinguished man, for he has put it in his power how he hadediety, for it is only what belongs to himself that he is compelled to do so.<br/><br/>
Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Man's works of its own activity, all these are in its power. And of these however only those which are done with reference to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow God.<br/><br/>
