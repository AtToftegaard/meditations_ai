<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><b>Meditations AI</b> is an ongoing proof of concept project. The objective is simply to learn more about NLP, text generation, and philosophy whilst experimenting with different ML architectures to produce something cool. The something really cool will be an algorithm based Stoic philosopher.</p>
<br>
<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>At the moment our Stoic philosopher has read very little philosophical texts, limiting themselves to The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Ofcourse any well to do philosopher would never think of limiting themselves to so little. Therefore, next steps are to widen this foundation of knowledge. I have written an <a href="">article</a> about our first steps into Stoic philosophy, please feel free to learn more about the building process there.</p>
<br>
<p>For now, please read our first draft of Stoic philosophy <a href="./works/meditations.txt">here</a>.</p>
